# monkey become frontend dev
~~trying to force myself to study~~

## ***this will be a kind of diary of my achievements***
- [DAY 1](#day-1)



# #**DAY 1**:sparkles:
today I'm going to try to recreate an instastory style site that I found on pinterest, let's see if I remember anything from a web development course at the university, because now I'll try to recreate the html / scc code to visually get something adequate
## example:
<img src="https://github.com/defur/monkey_become_frontend_dev/blob/main/img/Screenshot_1.png" width="400" height="750">

## result:
<img src="https://github.com/defur/monkey_become_frontend_dev/blob/main/img/Screenshot_2.png" width="800" height="450">

conclusions:

it was foolish to try to make a site for a laptop format from an example site for a phone. adaptive styles are still difficult for me, so I wrote the worst shit code that is embarrassing to show
