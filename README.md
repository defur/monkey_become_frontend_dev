# monkey become frontend dev
~~trying to force myself to study~~

## ***this will be a kind of diary of my achievements***

# #**DAY 1**:sparkles:
today I'm going to try to recreate an instastory style site that I found on pinterest, let's see if I remember anything from a web development course at the university, because now I'll try to recreate the html / scc code to visually get something adequate
## example:
<img src="https://github.com/defur/monkey_become_frontend_dev/blob/main/img/Screenshot_1.png" width="400" height="750">

## result:
<img src="https://github.com/defur/monkey_become_frontend_dev/blob/main/img/Screenshot_2.png" width="800" height="450">

conclusions:

it was foolish to try to make a site for a laptop format from an example site for a phone. adaptive styles are still difficult for me, so I wrote the worst shit code that is embarrassing to show


# #**DAY 2**:sparkles:
## today i made just a regular calculator, you can use it [here](https://defur.github.io/calculattor/)

# #**DAY 3**:sparkles:
## today I completed the calculator, now it is not just a "picture" but also works
I couldn't solve the problem that I had, I wanted that after the output of the result of calculations, when you click on a number, the data disappeared and at the same time the pressed number was recorded, but it turned out that when you click on any number first everything is erased and when you click again begins to record a new example, I don't know what to do with it, I'll just leave it like that.
